# Structure-Free Prediction and Mechanistic Interpretation of# Structure-Free Prediction and Mechanistic Interpretation of Protein–Ligand Binding Affinity via iBAMs

Accurate prediction of protein–ligand binding affinity is critical for accelerating drug discovery, yet traditional methods are constrained by their dependence on high-resolution structural data and limited mechanistic insight. Here, we introduce DeepBindMini, a novel, lightweight, structure-free deep learning framework that utilizes only protein sequences and ligand SMILES representations. By integrating a pre-trained protein language model (ESM2) with a convolutional neural network for residue-level feature extraction, and combining these features with chemically rich Morgan fingerprints via a dual cross-attention mechanism, DeepBindMini intrinsically generates Interpretable Binding Attention Maps (iBAMs). These maps provide high-resolution, bidirectional visualizations of key residue–ligand interactions, offering actionable mechanistic insights that guide hypothesis-driven lead optimization—without requiring three-dimensional structures.Accurate prediction of protein–ligand binding affinity is critical for accelerating drug discovery, yet traditional methods are constrained by their dependence on high-resolution structural data and limited mechanistic insight.
