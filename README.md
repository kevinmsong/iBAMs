# iBAMs
DeepBindMini is a lightweight, structure-free deep learning model that generates Interpretable Binding Attention Maps (iBAMs) from protein sequences and ligand SMILES. Using ESM2, CNNs, and dual cross-attention with Morgan fingerprints, iBAMs highlight key interactions to guide lead optimization.
